Hello !!!

I solve this crackme very quickly and i didn't look at the full code.

I used gdb, mostly, and ghidra.

In static analysis, i watched some interesting stuff:
    - It gets 4 numbers
    - Do some "magic"* transformation and return the correct digit in eax, so i looked for cmp eax, ebx, where eax contains the correct digit and ebx contains the user input.
    - In gdb, i just force the values, in order to achieve the cmp eax, ebx and the 4 digits were: 3674


* i mentioned magic, because i didn't look at the logic of the problem.

Let's test:

./crack3-by-D4RK_FL0W
Please Enter The Passcode:
Enter Digit 1: 1

Enter Digit 2: 2

Enter Digit 3: 3

Enter Digit 4: 4


WRONG

Now, with the correct answer:

./crack3-by-D4RK_FL0W
Please Enter The Passcode:
Enter Digit 1: 3

Enter Digit 2: 6

Enter Digit 3: 7

Enter Digit 4: 4


You Did It.
3674

Thanks for this crackme.
