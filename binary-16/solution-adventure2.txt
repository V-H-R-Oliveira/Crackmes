'''
The real size of argv[1]
strlen("3123" + 1) = 3;

statement to be verify:
 - The argv[1] must begin with 3.

if(strlen("3123" + 1) == (long)((int)*argv[1] + -0x30); yes, that match

It's obvious that the input has to be different then '222'.

so lets go into step2((unsigned long) argc, (long)argv, argc) function

cVar1 = **(char **)(argv + 8);  picks the first char of argv[1] so a '3';

the argument is opcional

the guess must be 66, because the result will always be 66, because hex(3) + 0xf (15) = int(66)

   Welcome to step 2 of chapter 2 !
   If you see this message because you randomly played with arguments
   but didn't complete the 1st step, please go back and run the program without arguments -> (Sequence to achive step2 function is 'Hello')
   Unless you're cheating ? meh... whatever...

   BUT !! If you completed the 1st step : CONGRATULATION \o/ !!

   ...
   Damn... I painstakingly coded this whole [go directly to step 2 stuff]
   So now i guess i really have to code a step 2
   Don't want to do it... (Just press enter or something and we'll improvise somehow)

   By the way, what argument did you use to come here ? 2
 2 ? good good... please remember it !

  (Press enter or whatever, who care ?)

- So you want to register to the guild ? Math question then !
- it's totally not because i'm lazy or anything ! Bakkaaaa~ !
what's 2 + 3 * 5 ? 66
BWAHAHAHAHA BAKAAAAAAAA !!! 0x5dd614a4 is super totally wrooong !
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

...

ho damn, that's right...
WHY ?

To be continued... (you really succeded but i'll kill you anyway. don't worry, you'll be fine)
