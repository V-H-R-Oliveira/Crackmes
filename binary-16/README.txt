friendly greetings !
thank you for downloading the chapter 2 <3

So... it's a little embarassing to say but the chapter 1 i submitted to crackemes.one wasn't the release version.
It's missing 1 challenge. So i include the complete version in this chapter2.

i tried to obsfucate the code (just) a little but it turn out that compiler optimization + ghidra amazing decompilation
remove most of my obfuscations...  The disassembly may be easier to read than the C source...
DOH!

The adventure2 is trying to mess with your head (it certainly messed up mine).

Good luck ! See you in chapter 3 =^_^=
