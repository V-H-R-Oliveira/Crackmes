The binary has the elf headers currupted, so you cannot dissamble it in objdump, and you cannot run it on gdb.

In order to fix it, i wrote a simple C code, that parses the elf and sets the shoff, the shstrndx, and the shnum to 0, and, sets the version to 1.
After fixed, you can debug it on gdb.

Running with strace, it shows a call to ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME). 
To be able to debug on gdb, you should bypass the anti-debug trick.

On ghidra, the ptrace_call consist in:

void ptrace_call(void)
{
  /* var declarations */

  file_handler = fopen("/tmp","r");
  fd = fileno(file_handler);

  if (5 < fd) {
    puts("I\'m sorry GDB! You are not allowed!");
    exit(1);
  }

  fclose(file_handler);
  asm("int 80");
  global_val_code = (unsigned int) -1; // -1 if you run with gdb or tracing, otherwise it will be 0 or a positive number

  if (global_val_code < 0) {
    puts("Tracing is not allowed... Bye!");
    exit(1);
  }

  // success, you can continue the debugging.
}

There are a couple of ways to bypass, but i simply switch eax in fileno output to be 4. (set $eax=0x4) (5 < 4 == false), 
and eax to be a positive number, like 1. (set $eax=0x1) (1 < 0 == false).

After the bypass, it reads 10 characters from stdin and encode it by oring with 0x90 (input[i] |= 0x90).
Then, it loads the encrypted password and compares each byte of the encrypted password with each byte of the encoded input (enc_data[i] == encoded_input[i]);
If it isn't equal, then return -1, otherwise, if all the bytes are equal, then return 0.

There are two methods to solve it.

1ยบ method - apply the reverse operation of | (logic +) in the encrypted flag (encrypted_flag[i] -= 0x90);
2ยบ method - apply a xor with the encrypted flag and 0x90. (encrypted_flag[i] ^= 0x90).

The correct output, for both methods, will be "ghadah#ll".

Let's test it.

./crackme.02.32 
Please tell me my password: 123456789
No! No! No! No! Try again.

./crackme.02.32 
Please tell me my password: ghadah#ll
The password is correct!
Congratulations!!!

Thanks for the crackme.
