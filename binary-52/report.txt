A little tricky crackme.

First, it prompts for the size of the passwd, which should be 10.
If it's greater than 10, it will assign the size to 10, otherwise it will keep the original size.

After that, it will load the password to a buffer, ghnuhbijra, and it will append a @.

Then, It will prompt for the password characters, and it will compare each inputed char to each password character until it reaches @, or, until it founds two different characters.
If all the bytes match, then it will display the good message, otherwise, it will display the bad message.

Let's test it:

Bad password:

./crackme
Password: 10
1

3
4
5
6
7

Login unsuccessful.


Good password:

./crackme
Password: 10

Thanks for the crackme.
