A simple crackme with an corrupted elf.
While you don't fix the headers, you cannot debug it.

With that in mind, i made a C code that fixs only one field of the elf structures, which is e_shstrndx, assign it to 0.
The fix.c does that, and generate a debuggable copy of the thellurik.

The program reads an username and a serial from stdin. (note: there is a buffer overflow vuln, because he doesn't verify the size of both entries);
Then, it will sum all the username ascii characters and it will compute a "checksum" (see in keygen.py).
After it will put 1337 and the checksum in a format string (again see in keygen.py) and will compare with the user serial.
If it's correct, i will print the good message, otherwise it will print the bad message.

Thanks for the crackme.
