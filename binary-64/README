Dr.Spliff's Crackme - v0.1 (Alpha) (Linux/ia32)

------
Intro:
This is a quick reference implementation of a protection scheme. In total 
it took about two hours from start to finish (including testing and debugging)
to get this lil crackme finished.

--------
Details:
It's written in C, with pieces of hand-tweaked assembler. Compiled using gcc 3.3.1.

------
Goals:
Your goals for this crackme are to patch the application so that it thinks
any key you enter is valid. Any other neat tricks, or not so obvious methods
of cracking this would be nice to see.

It is trivially easy create a 'keygen' for this, i spent all of 20 minutes writing that part!

	while (l_name[0] != '\0')
	{
		l_key += l_name[0];
		l_name++;
	}

So dont bother - lamerPoints++ :)

-----------------
Before you start:
This was compiled on a glibc 2.3 system (SuSE 9), if you're running an earlier 
version of glibc you're gonna run into trouble.

-----
Tips:
your looking for 56 bytes of position independant fairy dust :)

Cheers:
Happy new year, now get cracking.
