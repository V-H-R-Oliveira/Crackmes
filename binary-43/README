Hello!!

The solution for this problem was very simple.

I only used ghidra to solve this crackme.

It takes an username and a serial, which must have the length divisible by 10, otherwise it will fail.
The username must be only alpha characteres and the serial must be only alphanumeric characteres.

After, it will get the username and loop into it's length, and it will use the current calculation:
    => username_calc += (( (i + 1) * (i + 1)) % (( (i + 1) - 2) + ord(username[i]))), where i is the current string state.

The serial will suffer a similar calculation, which is:
    => serial_calc += (ord(serial[j]) % ((j + 1) + 8)), where j is the current string state.

Finally, it will assert if both calculations are equal, and if it is equal, it will crack the program, otherwise it will fail.

I built a python 3 keygen to solve this crackme.

Let's test:
    - First, with the wrong input:
        ./crack
        Enter username : vvvv
        Enter serial number :1234567890
        invalid login!!

    - Finally, with the correct input, note that username could have more than one key:
        ./crack
        Enter username : vvvv
        Enter serial number :x21dcWzSUJ
        Login complete!!

Thanks for this crackme.
